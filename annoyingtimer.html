<h1>The annoying timer</h1>

<p>Have you ever wanted your browser to bother you every x minutes that it has been x minutes? Who hasn't? Well, now you can.</p>
<p>Introducing the productivity tool to end all productivity tools: the annoying timer. Now, you can have your work rudely interrupted by your browser reminding you that you did not get as much done as you planned.</p>
<p>Just input a number of minutes to begin.</p>
<p>Warning: once it starts, it won't stop. Ever. Unless you close the page, I guess.</p>

<div id="timer">
 <input type="number" id="userInput"></input>
 <button class="btn" onclick="timeAlert()">Start</button>
